# AZD for AI Developers Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for learning Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on AI application deployment. This workshop helps you gain an applied understanding of AZD templates in 3 steps:

1. **Discovery** - find the template that is right for you.
1. **Deployment** - deploy and validate that it works
1. **Customization** - modify and iterate to make it yours!

Over the course of this workshop, you will also be introduced to core developer tools and workflows, to help you streamline your end-to-end development journey.

## Browser-Based Guide

The workshop lessons are in Markdown. You can navigate them directly in GitHub - or launch a browser-based preview as shown in the screenshot below.

To use this option - fork the repository to your profile, and launch GitHub Codespaces. Once the VS Code terminal is active, type this command:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

In a few seconds, you will see a pop-up dialog. Select the option to `Open in browser`. The web-based guide will now open in a new browser tab. Some benefits of this preview:

1. **Built-in search** - find keywords or lessons quickly.
1. **Copy icon** - hover over codeblocks to see this option
1. **Theme toggle** - switch between dark and light themes
1. **Get help** - click the Discord icon in footer to join!

## What You'll Learn

Think of the AZD Template as a learning sandbox to explore various capabilities and tools for end-to-end development on Azure AI Foundry. By the end of this workshop, you should have an intuitive sense for various tools and concepts in this context.

| Concept  | Objective |
|:---|:---|
| **Azure Developer CLI** | Understand tool commands and workflows|
| **AZD Templates**| Understand project structure and config|
| **Azure AI Agent**| Provision & deploy Azure AI Foundry project  |
| **Azure AI Search**| Enable context engineering with agents |
| **Observability**| Explore tracing, monitoring and evaluations |
| **Red Teaming**| Explore adversarial testing and mitigations |

### [Module 2: Validate AI Template](docs/instructions/2-Validate-AI-Template.md) (30 mins)

- What is the AI Template Architecture?
- What is the AZD Development Workflow?
- How can I get help with AZD Development?
- **Lab**: Deploy & Validate AI Agents template

### [Module 3: Deconstruct AI Template](docs/instructions/3-Deconstruct-AI-Template.md) (30 mins)

- Explore your environment in `.azure/` 
- Explore your resource setup in `infra/` 
- Explore your AZD configuration in `azure.yaml`s

## Workshop Challenge

Want to challenge yourself to do more? Here are some project suggestions - or share your ideas with us!!

| Project | Description |
|:---|:---|
|1. **Deconstruct A Complex AI Template** | Use the workflow and tools we outlined and see if you can deploy, validate, and customize a different AI solution template. _What did you learn?_|
|2. **Customize With Your Scenario**  | Try writing a PRD (Product Requirements Document) for a different scenario. Then use GitHub Copilot in your template repo in Agent Model - and ask it to generate a customization workflow for you. _What did you learn? How could you improve on these suggestions?_|
