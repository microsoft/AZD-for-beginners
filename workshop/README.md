# AZD for AI Developers Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for learning Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on AI application deployment. This workshop helps you gain an applied understanding of AZD templates in 3 steps:

1. **Discovery** - find the template that is right for you.
1. **Deployment** - deploy and validate that it works
1. **Customization** - modify and iterate to make it yours!

Over the course of this workshop, you will also be introduced to core developer tools and workflows, to help you streamline your end-to-end development journey.

## What You'll Learn

Think of the AZD Template as a learning sandbox to explore various capabilities and tools for end-to-end development on Azure AI Foundry. By the end of this workshop, you should have an intuitive sense for various tools and concepts in this context.

| Concept  | Objective |
|:---|:---|
| **Azure Developer CLI** | Understand tool commands and workflows|
| **AZD Templates**| Understand project structure and config|
| **Azure AI Agent**| Provision & deploy Azure AI Foundry project  |
| **Azure AI Search**| Enable context engineering with agents |
| **Observability**| Explore tracing, monitoring and evaluations |
| **Red Teaming**| Explore adversarial testing and mitigations |
| | |


## Workshop Structure

The workshop is structured to take you on a journey from template discovery, to deployment, deconstruction, and customization - using the official [Getting Started with AI Agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents) starter template as the basis.

### Module 1: Select AI Template (30 mins)

- What are AI Templates?
- Where can I find AI Templates?
- How can I get started building AI Agents?
- **Lab**: Quickstart with GitHub Codespaces

### Module 2: Validate AI Template (30 mins)

- What is the AI Template Architecture?
- What is the AZD Development Workflow?
- How can I get help with AZD Development?
- **Lab**: Deploy & Validate AI Agents template

### Module 3: Deconstruct AI Template (30 mins)

- Explore your environment in `.azure/` 
- Explore your resource setup in `infra/` 
- Explore your AZD configuration in `azure.yaml`s
- **Lab**: Modify Environment Variables & Redeploy

### Module 4: Configure AI Template (30 mins)
- Explore: Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Explore: Agent Evaluation & Red Teaming
- Explore: Tracing & Monitoring
- **Lab**: Explore AI Agent + Observability 

### Module 5: Customize AI Template (30 mins)
- Define: PRD with Scenario Requirements
- Configure: Environment Variables for AZD
- Implement: Lifecycle Hooks for added tasks
- **Lab**: Customize template for my scenario

### Module 6: Teardown Infrastructure (30 mins)
- Recap: What are AZD Templates?
- Recap: Why use Azure Developer CLI?
- Next Steps: Try a different template!
- **Lab**: Deprovision infrastructure & cleanup


## Workshop Challenge

Want to challenge yourself to do more? Here are some project suggestions - or share your ideas with us!!

| Project | Description |
|:---|:---|
|1. **Deconstruct A Complex AI Template** | Use the workflow and tools we outlined and see if you can deploy, validate, and customize a different AI solution template. _What did you learn?_|
|2. **Customize With Your Scenario**  | Try writing a PRD (Product Requirements Document) for a different scenario. Then use GitHub Copilot in your template repo in Agent Model - and ask it to generate a customization workflow for you. _What did you learn? How could you improve on these suggestions?_|
