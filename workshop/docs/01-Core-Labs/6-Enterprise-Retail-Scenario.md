## 6.2. Scenario Implementation


---

### 1. Pre-Deployment Config

Create a setup script (`setup-retail.sh`)

```bash title="" linenums="0"
#!/bin/bash

# Set environment name
azd env set AZURE_ENV_NAME "retail-ai-agents"

# Configure region (choose based on model availability)
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION "eastus2"

# Enable all optional services
azd env set USE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS true
azd env set USE_AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE true
azd env set ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING true

# Configure primary chat model (gpt-4o as closest available to gpt-4.1)
azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_MODEL_NAME "gpt-4o"
azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_MODEL_FORMAT "OpenAI"
azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "chat-primary"
azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY 150

# Configure embedding model for enhanced search
azd env set AZURE_AI_EMBED_MODEL_NAME "text-embedding-3-large"
azd env set AZURE_AI_EMBED_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "embeddings-large"
azd env set AZURE_AI_EMBED_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY 75

# Set agent name (will create first agent)
azd env set AZURE_AI_AGENT_NAME "shopper-agent"

# Configure search index
azd env set AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME "retail-products"

echo "Environment configured for retail deployment"

### 3: Deployment Script

Create `deploy-retail.sh`:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🚀 Starting Enterprise Retail AI Agents deployment..."

# Validate prerequisites
echo "📋 Validating prerequisites..."
if ! command -v azd &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Azure Developer CLI (azd) is required"
    exit 1
fi

if ! az account show &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Please login to Azure CLI: az login"
    exit 1
fi

# Set up environment
echo "🔧 Configuring deployment environment..."
chmod +x setup-retail.sh
./setup-retail.sh

# Check quota in selected region
echo "📊 Checking quota availability..."
LOCATION=$(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_LOCATION | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')
echo "Deploying to region: $LOCATION"
echo "⚠️  Please verify you have 300,000+ TPM quota for:"
echo "   - gpt-4o: 150,000 TPM"
echo "   - text-embedding-3-large: 75,000 TPM"
echo "   - Additional models: 75,000+ TPM"

read -p "Continue with deployment? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Deployment cancelled"
    exit 1
fi

# Deploy infrastructure and application
echo "🏗️  Deploying Azure infrastructure..."
azd up

# Capture deployment outputs
echo "📝 Capturing deployment information..."
azd show > deployment-info.txt

# Get the web app URL
APP_URL=$(azd show --output json | jq -r '.services.api_and_frontend.project.target.url // empty')

if [ ! -z "$APP_URL" ]; then
    echo "✅ Deployment completed successfully!"
    echo "🌐 Web Application: $APP_URL"
    echo "🔍 Azure Portal: Run 'azd show' for resource group link"
    echo "📊 AI Foundry Portal: https://ai.azure.com"
else
    echo "⚠️  Deployment completed but unable to retrieve URL"
    echo "Run 'azd show' for deployment details"
fi

echo "📚 Next steps:"
echo "1. Create second agent (Loyalty Agent) in AI Foundry portal"
echo "2. Upload product catalog to search index"
echo "3. Configure custom agent instructions"
echo "4. Test both agents with sample queries"
```

### 4: Post-Deployment Config

Create `configure-retail-agents.sh`:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔧 Configuring retail agents..."

# Get deployment information
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=$(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_EXISTING_AIPROJECT_ENDPOINT | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')
AGENT_ID=$(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_EXISTING_AGENT_ID | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')

echo "Project Endpoint: $PROJECT_ENDPOINT"
echo "Primary Agent ID: $AGENT_ID"

# Instructions for manual configuration
echo "

"
```

### 5: Testing and Validation

Create `test-retail-deployment.sh`:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
#!/bin/bash

echo "🧪 Testing retail deployment..."

# Verify environment variables are set
echo "📋 Checking environment configuration..."
azd env get-values | grep -E "(AZURE_AI_|USE_|ENABLE_)"

# Test web application availability
APP_URL=$(azd show --output json | jq -r '.services.api_and_frontend.project.target.url // empty')
if [ ! -z "$APP_URL" ]; then
    echo "🌐 Testing web application at: $APP_URL"
    HTTP_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$APP_URL")
    if [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "200" ]; then
        echo "✅ Web application is responding"
    else
        echo "❌ Web application returned status: $HTTP_STATUS"
    fi
else
    echo "❌ Could not retrieve web application URL"
fi

# Run evaluation if configured
if [ -f "evals/evaluate.py" ]; then
    echo "📊 Running agent evaluation..."
    cd evals
    python -m pip install -r ../src/requirements.txt
    python -m pip install azure-ai-evaluation
    python evaluate.py
    cd ..
fi

echo "
🎯 Deployment validation complete!

Next steps:
1. Access the web application and test basic functionality
2. Create the second agent (Loyalty Agent) in AI Foundry portal
3. Upload your product catalog and loyalty program data
4. Configure agent instructions for your specific use case
5. Run comprehensive testing with your retail scenarios
