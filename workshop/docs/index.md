Welcome to the hands-on workshop for learning Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on AI application deployment. This workshop helps you gain an applied understanding of AZD templates in 3 steps:

1. **Discovery** - find the template that is right for you.
1. **Deployment** - deploy and validate that it works
1. **Customization** - modify and iterate to make it yours!

Over the course of this workshop, you will also be introduced to core developer tools and workflows, to help you streamline your end-to-end development journey.
