# AZD For AI Developers

!!! info "AUDIENCE FOR THIS WORKSHOP"
   
    This workshop is for anyone looking to build AI Agentic applications on Azure AI Foundry by levreraging best-in-class tools and workflows. The workshop is suited to both beginners and experienced developers who have some familiarity with Azure, AI concepts and Python code. Please check the pre-requisites before you begin.

    **Duration:** 3-4 hours  
    s**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  


## 1. Motivation

Let's start with an analogy. Building a modern agentic AI application _from scratch_ is like building your new home yourself, brick-by-brick. Yes, it can be done. But it is not the most effective way to get your desired end result. Instead, we typically start with a design blueprint that we like, then work with an architect to customize it to our specific requirements.

Building an enterprise-ready AI solution can be viewed with that same lens. Start with a good _design architecture_ then work with a _solution architect_ to customize the design for your app scenario! But, how can you jumpstart this learning journey as an AI developer?

In this workshop, you'll learn to use three technologies to help you get there:

1. [Azure AI Foundry Templates](https://ai.azure.com/templates) - curated open-source repositories for popular application scenarios, defining _Infrastructure-as-code_ assets for consistency and reuse.
1. [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) - an open-source tool that uses these templates to streamline your end-to-end workflows from resource provisioning to deployment.
1. [GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) - a "co-architect" that is grounded in Azure knowledge, and can help you navigate the codebase and infrastructure using natural language (chat).

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a _sandbox_ repository that you can continue to explore, to build your own intuition for AZD templates and AI agent development for Azure AI Foundry.

## Workshop Outline

The workshop is structured as modules, each anchored by a hands-on lab exercise:

1. **Introduction** - Get an understanding of what AZD templates are, and how they work
1. **Selection** - Discover the right "starter" template for your next AI project
1. **Validation** - Deploy and explore the template to verify it works as advertised
1. **Deconstruction** - Take the template apart to understand its components & configuration
1. **Configuration** - Learn to activate and use different Azure AI Foundry features
1. **Customization** - Reconstruct the application with your data and requirements in mind
1. **Teardown** - Learn to deprovision infrastructure and recover soft-deleted resources
