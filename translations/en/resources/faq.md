---

## Configuration & Environments

### Q: How do I manage different environments (dev, staging, prod)?
**A**: Create separate environments with `azd env new <environment-name>` and configure different settings for each:
```bash
azd env new development
azd env new staging  
azd env new production
```

### Q: Where are environment configurations stored?
**A**: In the `.azure` folder within your project directory. Each environment has its own folder with configuration files.

### Q: How do I set environment-specific configuration?
**A**: Use `azd env set` to configure environment variables:
```bash
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus
azd env set DATABASE_TIER Basic
```

### Q: Can I share environment configurations across team members?
**A**: The `.azure` folder contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control. Instead:
1. Document required environment variables.
2. Use deployment scripts to set up environments.
3. Use Azure Key Vault for sensitive configuration.

### Q: How do I override template defaults?
**A**: Set environment variables that correspond to template parameters:
```bash
azd env set LOCATION "West US 2"
azd env set SKU_NAME "B1"
```
