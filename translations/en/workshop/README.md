# AZD for AI Developers Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop designed to teach you Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on deploying AI applications. This workshop will guide you through three key steps:

1. **Discovery** - Find the template that suits your needs.
2. **Deployment** - Deploy the template and ensure it works.
3. **Customization** - Modify and iterate to make it your own!

Throughout this workshop, you'll also be introduced to essential developer tools and workflows to streamline your end-to-end development process.

<br/>

## Browser-Based Guide

The workshop lessons are written in Markdown. You can navigate them directly on GitHub or launch a browser-based preview, as shown in the screenshot below.

To use this option, fork the repository to your profile and launch GitHub Codespaces. Once the VS Code terminal is active, type the following command:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

In a few seconds, a pop-up dialog will appear. Select the option to `Open in browser`. The web-based guide will open in a new browser tab. Benefits of this preview include:

1. **Built-in search** - Quickly find keywords or lessons.
2. **Copy icon** - Hover over code blocks to see this option.
3. **Theme toggle** - Switch between dark and light themes.
4. **Get help** - Click the Discord icon in the footer to join!

## Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Azure, AI concepts, VS Code, and command-line tools.

This is a hands-on workshop where you learn by doing. After completing the exercises, we recommend reviewing the AZD For Beginners curriculum to further explore Security and Productivity best practices.

## What You'll Learn

Think of the AZD Template as a sandbox for exploring various tools and capabilities for end-to-end development on Azure AI Foundry. By the end of this workshop, you should have a solid understanding of the tools and concepts in this context.

| Concept  | Objective |
|:---|:---|
| **Azure Developer CLI** | Learn tool commands and workflows |
| **AZD Templates** | Understand project structure and configuration |
| **Azure AI Agent** | Provision and deploy Azure AI Foundry projects |
| **Azure AI Search** | Enable context engineering with agents |
| **Observability** | Explore tracing, monitoring, and evaluations |
| **Red Teaming** | Learn adversarial testing and mitigation strategies |
