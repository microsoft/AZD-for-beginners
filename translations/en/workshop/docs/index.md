# AZD for AI Developers Workshop

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **This workshop includes a guide that you can preview in your local browser. To get started, you need to launch GitHub Codespaces on the repository‚Äîthen wait until you see an active VS Code terminal and type:**  
> `mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &`  
> **You should see a pop-up dialog to open the preview page in a browser.**

Welcome to this hands-on workshop designed to teach you how to use Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on deploying AI applications. This workshop will help you understand AZD templates through three key steps:

1. **Discovery** - Find the template that suits your needs.
2. **Deployment** - Deploy the template and ensure it works.
3. **Customization** - Modify and iterate to make it your own.

Throughout the workshop, you'll also be introduced to essential developer tools and workflows to streamline your end-to-end development process.
