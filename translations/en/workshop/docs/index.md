Welcome to this hands-on workshop designed to teach you how to use Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on deploying AI applications. This workshop will help you understand AZD templates through three key steps:

1. **Discovery** - Find the template that suits your needs.
2. **Deployment** - Deploy the template and ensure it works.
3. **Customization** - Modify and iterate to make it your own.

Throughout the workshop, you'll also be introduced to essential developer tools and workflows to streamline your end-to-end development process.
