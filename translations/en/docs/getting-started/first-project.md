**Chapter Navigation:**
- **üìö Course Home**: [AZD For Beginners](../../README.md)
- **üìñ Current Chapter**: Chapter 1 - Foundation & Quick Start
- **‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous**: [Installation & Setup](installation.md)
- **‚û°Ô∏è Next**: [Configuration](configuration.md)
- **üöÄ Next Chapter**: [Chapter 2: AI-First Development](../ai-foundry/azure-ai-foundry-integration.md)

## Introduction

Welcome to your first Azure Developer CLI project! This hands-on tutorial will guide you step-by-step through creating, deploying, and managing a full-stack application on Azure using azd. You'll work on a real-world todo application featuring a React frontend, Node.js API backend, and MongoDB database.

## Learning Goals

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Learn how to initialize azd projects using templates
- Understand the structure and configuration files of an Azure Developer CLI project
- Deploy a complete application to Azure, including infrastructure provisioning
- Make updates to the application and redeploy it
- Manage multiple environments for development and staging
- Practice resource cleanup and cost management

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Independently initialize and configure azd projects using templates
- Navigate and modify the structure of azd projects
- Deploy full-stack applications to Azure with a single command
- Troubleshoot common deployment and authentication issues
- Manage multiple Azure environments for different stages of deployment
- Set up continuous deployment workflows for application updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites Checklist
- ‚úÖ Azure Developer CLI installed ([Installation Guide](installation.md))
- ‚úÖ Azure CLI installed and authenticated
- ‚úÖ Git installed on your system
- ‚úÖ Node.js 16+ (required for this tutorial)
- ‚úÖ Visual Studio Code (recommended)

### Verify Your Setup
```bash
# Check azd installation
azd version
```
### Verify Azure authentication

```bash
az account show
```

### Check Node.js version
```bash
node --version
```

## Step 1: Choose and Initialize a Template

Start by selecting a popular todo application template that includes a React frontend and Node.js API backend.

```bash
# Browse available templates
azd template list

# Initialize the todo app template
mkdir my-first-azd-app
cd my-first-azd-app
azd init --template todo-nodejs-mongo

# Follow the prompts:
# - Enter an environment name: "dev"
# - Choose a subscription (if you have multiple)
# - Choose a region: "East US 2" (or your preferred region)
```

### What Just Happened?
- The template code was downloaded to your local directory
- An `azure.yaml` file was created with service definitions
- Infrastructure code was set up in the `infra/` directory
- An environment configuration was created

## Step 2: Explore the Project Structure

Take a closer look at what azd has created for you:

```bash
# View the project structure
tree /f   # Windows
# or
find . -type f | head -20   # macOS/Linux
```

You should see:
```
my-first-azd-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .azd/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json              # Project configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .azure/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/                     # Environment-specific files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .devcontainer/               # Development container config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/           # GitHub Actions CI/CD

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Node.js dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile         # Container configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                   # React frontend
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/               # React source code
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # React dependencies
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile         # Container configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure.yaml                  # azd project configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Project documentation
```

### Key Files to Understand

**azure.yaml** - The core configuration file of your azd project:
```bash
# View the project configuration
cat azure.yaml
```

**infra/main.bicep** - Defines the infrastructure:
```bash
# View the infrastructure code
head -30 infra/main.bicep
```

## Step 3: Customize Your Project (Optional)

Before deploying, you can personalize the application:

### Modify the Frontend
```bash
# Open the React app component
code src/web/src/App.tsx
```

Make a simple change:
```typescript
// Find the title and change it
<h1>My Awesome Todo App</h1>
```

### Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Set custom environment variables
azd env set WEBSITE_TITLE "My First AZD App"
azd env set API_VERSION "v1.18"
# View all environment variables
azd env get-values
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Azure

Now comes the exciting part‚Äîdeploying everything to Azure!

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure and application
azd up

# This command will:
# 1. Provision Azure resources (App Service, Cosmos DB, etc.)
# 2. Build your application
# 3. Deploy to the provisioned resources
# 4. Display the application URL
```

### What's Happening During Deployment?

The `azd up` command performs the following steps:
1. **Provision** (`azd provision`) - Creates Azure resources
2. **Package** - Builds your application code
3. **Deploy** (`azd deploy`) - Deploys the code to Azure resources

### Expected Output
```
Packaging services (azd package)

SUCCESS: Your up workflow to provision and deploy to Azure completed in 4 minutes 32 seconds.

You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-my-first-azd-app-dev in the Azure portal:
https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/rg-my-first-azd-app-dev

Navigate to the Todo app at:
https://app-web-abc123def.azurewebsites.net
```

## Step 5: Test Your Application

### Access Your Application
Click the URL provided in the deployment output, or retrieve it anytime:
```bash
# Get application endpoints
azd show

# Open the application in your browser
azd show --output json | jq -r '.services.web.endpoint'
```

### Test the Todo App
1. **Add a todo item** - Click "Add Todo" and enter a task
2. **Mark as complete** - Check off completed items
3. **Delete items** - Remove tasks you no longer need

### Monitor Your Application
```bash
# Open Azure portal for your resources
azd monitor

# View application logs
azd logs
```

## Step 6: Make Changes and Redeploy

Make a change and see how easy it is to update your application:

### Modify the API
```bash
# Edit the API code
code src/api/src/routes/lists.js
```

Add a custom response header:
```javascript
// Find a route handler and add:
res.header('X-Powered-By', 'Azure Developer CLI');
```

### Deploy Just the Code Changes
```bash
# Deploy only the application code (skip infrastructure)
azd deploy

# This is much faster than 'azd up' since infrastructure already exists
```

## Step 7: Manage Multiple Environments

Create a staging environment to test changes before deploying to production:

```bash
# Create a new staging environment
azd env new staging

# Deploy to staging
azd up

# Switch back to dev environment
azd env select dev

# List all environments
azd env list
```

### Environment Comparison
```bash
# View dev environment
azd env select dev
azd show

# View staging environment  
azd env select staging
azd show
```

## Step 8: Clean Up Resources

When you're done experimenting, clean up to avoid unnecessary charges:

```bash
# Delete all Azure resources for current environment
azd down

# Force delete without confirmation and purge soft-deleted resources
azd down --force --purge

# Delete specific environment
azd env select staging
azd down --force --purge
```

## What You've Learned

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- Initialized an azd project using a template
- Explored the project structure and key files
- Deployed a full-stack application to Azure
- Made code changes and redeployed
- Managed multiple environments
- Cleaned up resources

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Errors
```bash
# Re-authenticate with Azure
az login

# Verify subscription access
az account show
```

### Deployment Failures
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export AZD_DEBUG=true
azd up --debug

# View detailed logs
azd logs --service api
azd logs --service web
```

### Resource Name Conflicts
```bash
# Use a unique environment name
azd env new dev-$(whoami)-$(date +%s)
```

### Port/Network Issues
```bash
# Check if ports are available
netstat -an | grep :3000
netstat -an | grep :3100
```
