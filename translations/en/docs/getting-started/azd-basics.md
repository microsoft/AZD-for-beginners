## What is Azure Developer CLI (azd)?

Azure Developer CLI (azd) is a command-line tool designed to simplify and speed up the process of building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications on Azure.

## Core Concepts

### Templates
Templates are the backbone of azd. They include:
- **Application code** - Your source code and dependencies
- **Infrastructure definitions** - Azure resources defined using Bicep or Terraform
- **Configuration files** - Settings and environment variables
- **Deployment scripts** - Automated workflows for deployment

### Environments
Environments represent different deployment targets:
- **Development** - For testing and development purposes
- **Staging** - Pre-production environment
- **Production** - Live production environment

Each environment has its own:
- Azure resource group
- Configuration settings
- Deployment state

### Services
Services are the individual components of your application:
- **Frontend** - Web applications or single-page apps
- **Backend** - APIs or microservices
- **Database** - Data storage solutions
- **Storage** - File and blob storage

## Key Features

### 1. Template-Driven Development
```bash
# Browse available templates
azd template list

# Initialize from a template
azd init --template <template-name>
```

### 2. Infrastructure as Code
- **Bicep** - Azure's domain-specific language for infrastructure
- **Terraform** - A multi-cloud infrastructure tool
- **ARM Templates** - Azure Resource Manager templates

### 3. Integrated Workflows
```bash
# Complete deployment workflow
azd up            # Provision + Deploy
azd provision     # Create Azure resources
azd deploy        # Deploy application code
azd down          # Clean up resources
```

### 4. Environment Management
```bash
# Create and manage environments
azd env new <environment-name>
azd env select <environment-name>
azd env list
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

A typical azd project structure:
```
my-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .azd/                    # azd configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .azure/                  # Azure deployment artifacts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .devcontainer/          # Development container config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/      # GitHub Actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscode/               # VS Code settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/                 # Infrastructure code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.bicep        # Main infrastructure template
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.parameters.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/          # Reusable modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                  # Application source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/             # Backend services
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/             # Frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure.yaml           # azd project configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üîß Configuration Files

### azure.yaml
The main configuration file for the project:
```yaml
name: my-awesome-app
metadata:
  template: my-template@1.0.0

services:
  web:
    project: ./src/web
    language: js
    host: appservice
  api:
    project: ./src/api
    language: js
    host: appservice

hooks:
  preprovision:
    shell: pwsh
    run: echo "Preparing to provision..."
```

### .azure/config.json
Configuration specific to each environment:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "defaultEnvironment": "dev",
  "environments": {
    "dev": {
      "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
      "location": "eastus"
    }
  }
}
```

## üé™ Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# Method 1: Use existing template
azd init --template todo-nodejs-mongo

# Method 2: Start from scratch
azd init

# Method 3: Use current directory
azd init .
```

### Development Cycle
```bash
# Set up development environment
azd auth login
azd env new dev
azd env select dev

# Deploy everything
azd up

# Make changes and redeploy
azd deploy

# Clean up when done
azd down --force --purge
```

### Managing Multiple Environments
```bash
# Create staging environment
azd env new staging
azd env select staging
azd up

# Switch back to dev
azd env select dev

# Compare environments
azd env list
```

## üß≠ Navigation Commands

### Discovery
```bash
azd template list              # Browse templates
azd template show <template>   # Template details
azd init --help               # Initialization options
```

### Project Management
```bash
azd show                     # Project overview
azd env show                 # Current environment
azd config list             # Configuration settings
```

### Monitoring
```bash
azd monitor                  # Open Azure portal
azd pipeline config          # Set up CI/CD
azd logs                     # View application logs
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Meaningful Names
```bash
# Good
azd env new production-east
azd init --template web-app-secure

# Avoid
azd env new env1
azd init --template template1
```

### 2. Leverage Templates
- Start with pre-existing templates
- Customize them to fit your needs
- Create reusable templates for your organization

### 3. Environment Isolation
- Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Avoid deploying directly to production from your local machine
- Use CI/CD pipelines for production deployments

### 4. Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Keep configuration files under version control
- Document settings specific to each environment
