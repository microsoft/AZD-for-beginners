## Module 1: Understanding AZD Structure for AI Applications

### Anatomy of an AI AZD Template

Explore the key files in an AZD template designed for AI applications:

```
azure-search-openai-demo/
├── azure.yaml              # AZD configuration
├── infra/                   # Infrastructure as Code
│   ├── main.bicep          # Main infrastructure template
│   ├── main.parameters.json # Environment parameters
│   └── modules/            # Reusable Bicep modules
│       ├── openai.bicep    # Azure OpenAI configuration
│       ├── search.bicep    # Cognitive Search setup
│       └── webapp.bicep    # Web app configuration
├── app/                    # Application code
├── scripts/               # Deployment scripts
└── .azure/               # AZD environment files
```

### **Lab Exercise 1.1: Explore the Configuration**

1. **Examine the azure.yaml file:**
```bash
cat azure.yaml
```

**What to look for:**
- Definitions for AI-related services
- Mappings for environment variables
- Host configurations

2. **Review the main.bicep infrastructure file:**
```bash
cat infra/main.bicep
```

**Key AI patterns to identify:**
- Provisioning Azure OpenAI services
- Integration with Cognitive Search
- Secure key management
- Network security configurations

### **Discussion Point:** Why These Patterns Matter for AI

- **Service Dependencies**: AI applications often rely on multiple interconnected services.
- **Security**: API keys and endpoints must be securely managed.
- **Scalability**: AI workloads have specific scaling needs.
- **Cost Management**: Proper configuration can help control expenses for AI services.

## Module 2: Deploy Your First AI Application

### Step 2.1: Initialize the Environment

1. **Create a new AZD environment:**
```bash
azd env new myai-workshop
```

2. **Set required parameters:**
```bash
# Set your preferred Azure region
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus

# Optional: Set specific OpenAI model
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL gpt-35-turbo
```

### Step 2.2: Deploy the Infrastructure and Application

1. **Deploy with AZD:**
```bash
azd up
```

**What happens during `azd up`:**
- ✅ Azure OpenAI service is provisioned
- ✅ Cognitive Search service is created
- ✅ App Service is set up for the web application
- ✅ Networking and security are configured
- ✅ Application code is deployed
- ✅ Monitoring and logging are set up

2. **Monitor the deployment progress** and note the resources being created.

### Step 2.3: Verify Your Deployment

1. **Check the deployed resources:**
```bash
azd show
```

2. **Open the deployed application:**
```bash
azd show --output json | grep "webAppUrl"
```

3. **Test the AI functionality:**
   - Navigate to the web application
   - Try sample queries
   - Verify that AI responses are working correctly

### **Lab Exercise 2.1: Troubleshooting Practice**

**Scenario**: Your deployment succeeded, but the AI isn't responding.

**Common issues to check:**
1. **OpenAI API keys**: Ensure they are correctly configured.
2. **Model availability**: Verify that your region supports the model.
3. **Network connectivity**: Confirm that services can communicate.
4. **RBAC permissions**: Check if the app has access to OpenAI.

**Debugging commands:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
azd env get-values

# View deployment logs
az webapp log tail --name YOUR_APP_NAME --resource-group YOUR_RG

# Check OpenAI deployment status
az cognitiveservices account deployment list --name YOUR_OPENAI_NAME --resource-group YOUR_RG
```

## Module 3: Customizing AI Applications for Your Needs

### Step 3.1: Modify the AI Configuration

1. **Update the OpenAI model:**
```bash
# Change to a different model (if available in your region)
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL gpt-4

# Redeploy with the new configuration
azd deploy
```

2. **Add additional AI services:**

Edit `infra/main.bicep` to include Document Intelligence:

```bicep
// Add to main.bicep
resource documentIntelligence 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts@2023-05-01' = {
  name: 'doc-intel-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
  location: location
  kind: 'FormRecognizer'
  sku: {
    name: 'F0'  // Free tier for workshop
  }
  properties: {
    customSubDomainName: 'doc-intel-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
  }
}
```

### Step 3.2: Environment-Specific Configurations

**Best Practice**: Use different configurations for development and production environments.

1. **Create a production environment:**
```bash
azd env new myai-production
```

2. **Set production-specific parameters:**
```bash
# Production typically uses higher SKUs
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SKU S0
azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SKU standard

# Enable additional security features
azd env set ENABLE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS true
```

### **Lab Exercise 3.1: Cost Optimization**

**Challenge**: Configure the template for cost-effective development.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify which SKUs can be set to free/basic tiers.
2. Configure environment variables to minimize costs.
3. Deploy and compare costs with the production configuration.

**Solution hints:**
- Use F0 (free) tier for Cognitive Services when possible.
- Use Basic tier for Search Service in development.
- Consider using Consumption plan for Functions.

## Module 4: Security and Production Best Practices

### Step 4.1: Secure Credential Management

**Current challenge**: Many AI applications hardcode API keys or use insecure storage.

**AZD Solution**: Managed Identity + Key Vault integration.

1. **Review the security configuration in your template:**
```bash
# Look for Key Vault and Managed Identity configuration
grep -r "keyVault\|managedIdentity" infra/
```

2. **Verify Managed Identity is working:**
```bash
# Check if the web app has the correct identity configuration
az webapp identity show --name YOUR_APP_NAME --resource-group YOUR_RG
```

### Step 4.2: Network Security

1. **Enable private endpoints** (if not already configured):

Add to your bicep template:
```bicep
// Private endpoint for OpenAI
resource openAIPrivateEndpoint 'Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints@2023-04-01' = {
  name: 'pe-openai-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
  location: location
  properties: {
    subnet: {
      id: vnet.properties.subnets[0].id
    }
    privateLinkServiceConnections: [
      {
        name: 'openai-connection'
        properties: {
          privateLinkServiceId: openAIAccount.id
          groupIds: ['account']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4.3: Monitoring and Observability

1. **Configure Application Insights:**
```bash
# Application Insights should be automatically configured
# Check the configuration:
az monitor app-insights component show --app YOUR_APP_NAME --resource-group YOUR_RG
```

2. **Set up AI-specific monitoring:**

Add custom metrics for AI operations:
```bicep
// In your web app configuration
resource webApp 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2023-01-01' = {
  properties: {
    siteConfig: {
      appSettings: [
        {
          name: 'APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING'
          value: applicationInsights.properties.ConnectionString
        }
        {
          name: 'OPENAI_MONITOR_ENABLED'
          value: 'true'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Lab Exercise 4.1: Security Audit**

**Task**: Review your deployment for security best practices.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code or configuration
- [ ] Managed Identity used for service-to-service authentication
- [ ] Key Vault stores sensitive configuration
- [ ] Network access is properly restricted
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are enabled

// Your AI services here
module openAI 'modules/openai.bicep' = {
  name: 'openai'
  params: {
    name: openAIServiceName
    location: location
  }
}
```

**infra/modules/openai.bicep** - OpenAI module:
```bicep
@description('Name of the OpenAI service')
param name string

@description('Location for the OpenAI service')
param location string

resource openAIAccount 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts@2023-05-01' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  kind: 'OpenAI'
  sku: {
    name: 'S0'
  }
  properties: {
    customSubDomainName: name
  }
}

output endpoint string = openAIAccount.properties.endpoint
output name string = openAIAccount.name
```
