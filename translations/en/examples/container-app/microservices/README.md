# Microservices Architecture - Container App Example

⏱️ **Estimated Time**: 25-35 minutes | 💰 **Estimated Cost**: ~$50-100/month | ⭐ **Complexity**: Advanced

A **simplified but functional** microservices architecture deployed to Azure Container Apps using AZD CLI. This example demonstrates service-to-service communication, container orchestration, and monitoring with a practical 2-service setup.

> **📚 Learning Approach**: This example starts with a minimal 2-service architecture (API Gateway + Backend Service) that you can actually deploy and learn from. After mastering this foundation, we provide guidance for expanding to a full microservices ecosystem.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this example, you will:
- Deploy multiple containers to Azure Container Apps
- Implement service-to-service communication with internal networking
- Configure environment-based scaling and health checks
- Monitor distributed applications with Application Insights
- Understand microservices deployment patterns and best practices
- Learn progressive expansion from simple to complex architectures

## Architecture

### Phase 1: What We're Building (Included in This Example)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Internet[Internet] -- HTTPS --> Gateway[API Gateway<br/>Node.js Container<br/>Routes requests<br/>Health checks<br/>Request logging]
    Gateway -- HTTP internal --> Product[Product Service<br/>Python Container<br/>Product CRUD<br/>In-memory data store<br/>REST API]
    Product --> Insights[Application Insights<br/>Monitoring & Logs]
```
**Why Start Simple?**
- ✅ Deploy and understand quickly (25-35 minutes)
- ✅ Learn core microservices patterns without complexity
- ✅ Working code you can modify and experiment with
- ✅ Lower cost for learning (~$50-100/month vs $300-1400/month)
- ✅ Build confidence before adding databases and message queues

**Analogy**: Think of this like learning to drive. You start with an empty parking lot (2 services), master the basics, then progress to city traffic (5+ services with databases).

### Phase 2: Future Expansion (Reference Architecture)

```

**What Each Component Does:**

**Infrastructure (infra/)**:
- `main.bicep`: Orchestrates all Azure resources and their dependencies
- `core/container-apps-environment.bicep`: Creates the Container Apps environment and Azure Container Registry
- `core/monitor.bicep`: Sets up Application Insights for distributed logging
- `app/*.bicep`: Individual container app definitions with scaling and health checks

**API Gateway (src/api-gateway/)**:
- Public-facing service that routes requests to backend services
- Implements logging, error handling, and request forwarding
- Demonstrates service-to-service HTTP communication

**Product Service (src/product-service/)**:
- Internal service with product catalog (in-memory for simplicity)
- REST API with health checks
- Example of backend microservice pattern

## Services Overview

### API Gateway (Node.js/Express)

**Port**: 8080  
**Access**: Public (external ingress)  
**Purpose**: Routes incoming requests to appropriate backend services  

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/products` - Forward to product service (list all)
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Forward to product service (get by ID)

**Key Features**:
- Request routing with axios
- Centralized logging
- Error handling and timeout management
- Service discovery via environment variables
- Application Insights integration

**Code Highlight** (`src/api-gateway/app.js`):
```javascript
// Comunicación interna del servicio
app.get('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`);
  res.json(response.data);
});
```

### Product Service (Python/Flask)

**Port**: 8000  
**Access**: Internal only (no external ingress)  
**Purpose**: Manages product catalog with in-memory data  

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /products` - List all products
- `GET /products/<id>` - Get product by ID

**Key Features**:
- RESTful API with Flask
- In-memory product store (simple, no database needed)
- Health monitoring with probes
- Structured logging
- Application Insights integration

**Data Model**:
```python
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "High-performance laptop",
  "price": 999.99,
  "stock": 50
}
```

**Why Internal Only?**
The product service is not exposed publicly. All requests must go through the API Gateway, which provides:
- Security: Controlled access point
- Flexibility: Can change backend without affecting clients
- Monitoring: Centralized request logging

## Understanding Service Communication

### How Services Talk to Each Other

In this example, the API Gateway communicates with the Product Service using **internal HTTP calls**:

```javascript
// API Gateway (src/api-gateway/app.js)
const PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL = process.env.PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL;

// Make internal HTTP request
const response = await axios.get(`${PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/products`);
```

**Key Points**:

1. **DNS-Based Discovery**: Container Apps automatically provides DNS for internal services
   - Product Service FQDN: `product-service.internal.<environment>.azurecontainerapps.io`
   - Simplified as: `http://product-service` (Container Apps resolves it)

2. **No Public Exposure**: Product Service has `external: false` in Bicep
   - Only accessible within the Container Apps environment
   - Cannot be reached from the internet

3. **Environment Variables**: Service URLs are injected at deployment time
   - Bicep passes the internal FQDN to the gateway
   - No hardcoded URLs in application code

**Analogy**: Think of this like office rooms. The API Gateway is the reception desk (public-facing), and the Product Service is an office room (internal only). Visitors must go through reception to reach any office.

## Deployment Options

### Full Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy the infrastructure and both services
azd up
```

This deploys:
1. Container Apps environment
2. Application Insights
3. Container Registry
4. API Gateway container
5. Product Service container

**Time**: 8-12 minutes

### Deploy Individual Service

```bash
# Déployez un seul service (après le premier azd up)
azd deploy api-gateway

# Ou déployez le service produit
azd deploy product-service
```

**Use Case**: When you've updated code in one service and want to redeploy only that service.

### Update Configuration

```bash
# Change scaling parameters
azd env set GATEWAY_MAX_REPLICAS 30

# Redeploy with new configuration
azd up
```

## Configuration

### Scaling Configuration

Both services are configured with HTTP-based autoscaling in their Bicep files:

**API Gateway**:
- Min replicas: 2 (always at least 2 for availability)
- Max replicas: 20
- Scale trigger: 50 concurrent requests per replica

**Product Service**:
- Min replicas: 1 (can scale to zero if needed)
- Max replicas: 10
- Scale trigger: 100 concurrent requests per replica

**Customize Scaling** (in `infra/app/*.bicep`):
```bicep
scale: {
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules: [
    {
      name: 'http-scale-rule'
      http: {
        metadata: {
          concurrentRequests: '100'  // Adjust this
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resource Allocation

**API Gateway**:
- CPU: 1.0 vCPU
- Memory: 2 GiB
- Reason: Handles all external traffic

**Product Service**:
- CPU: 0.5 vCPU
- Memory: 1 GiB
- Reason: Lightweight in-memory operations

### Health Checks

Both services include liveness and readiness probes:

```bicep
probes: [
  {
    type: 'Liveness'
    httpGet: {
      path: '/health'
      port: 8080
    }
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 30
  }
  {
    type: 'Readiness'
    httpGet: {
      path: '/health'
      port: 8080
    }
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 10
  }
]
```

**What This Means**:
- **Liveness**: If health check fails, Container Apps restarts the container
- **Readiness**: If not ready, Container Apps stops routing traffic to that replica



## Monitoring & Observability

### View Service Logs

```bash
# View logs using azd monitor
azd monitor --logs

# Or use Azure CLI for specific Container Apps:
# Stream logs from API Gateway
az containerapp logs show --name api-gateway --resource-group $RG_NAME --follow

# View recent product service logs
az containerapp logs show --name product-service --resource-group $RG_NAME --tail 100
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[api-gateway] API Gateway listening on port 8080
[api-gateway] Product Service URL: http://product-service
[api-gateway] GET /api/products 200 - 45ms
[product-service] Retrieved 5 products
```

### Application Insights Queries

Access Application Insights in Azure Portal, then run these queries:

**Find Slow Requests**:
```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where duration > 1000  // Requests taking >1 second
| summarize count() by name, cloud_RoleName
| order by count_ desc
```

**Track Service-to-Service Calls**:
```kusto
dependencies
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where type == "Http"
| project timestamp, name, target, duration, success
| order by timestamp desc
```

**Error Rate by Service**:
```kusto
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize errorCount = count() by cloud_RoleName, type
| order by errorCount desc
```

**Request Volume Over Time**:
```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| summarize requestCount = count() by bin(timestamp, 5m), cloud_RoleName
| render timechart
```

### Access Monitoring Dashboard

```bash
# Get Application Insights details
azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS

# Open Azure Portal monitoring
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --app $(azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  --resource-group $(azd env get-values | grep AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  --query "appId" -o tsv
```

### Live Metrics

1. Navigate to Application Insights in Azure Portal
2. Click "Live Metrics"
3. See real-time requests, failures, and performance
4. Test by running: `curl $(azd env get-values | grep API_GATEWAY_URL | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"')/api/products`

## Practical Exercises

[Note: See full exercises above in the "Practical Exercises" section for detailed step-by-step exercises including deployment verification, data modification, autoscaling tests, error handling, and adding a third service.]

## Cost Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs (For This 2-Service Example)

| Resource | Configuration | Estimated Cost |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| API Gateway | 2-20 replicas, 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM | $30-150 |
| Product Service | 1-10 replicas, 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM | $15-75 |
| Container Registry | Basic tier | $5 |
| Application Insights | 1-2 GB/month | $5-10 |
| Log Analytics | 1 GB/month | $3 |
| **Total** | | **$58-243/month** |

**Cost Breakdown by Usage**:
- **Light traffic** (testing/learning): ~$60/month
- **Moderate traffic** (small production): ~$120/month
- **High traffic** (busy periods): ~$240/month

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Scale to Zero for Development**:
   ```bicep
   scale: {
     minReplicas: 0  // Save $30-40/month when not in use
     maxReplicas: 10
   }
   ```

2. **Use Consumption Plan for Cosmos DB** (when you add it):
   - Pay only for what you use
   - No minimum charge

3. **Set Application Insights Sampling**:
   ```javascript
   appInsights.defaultClient.config.samplingPercentage = 50; // Sample 50% of requests
   ```

4. **Clean Up When Not Needed**:
   ```bash
   azd down
   ```

### Free Tier Options

For learning/testing, consider:

- Use Azure free credits (first 30 days)
- Keep to minimum replicas
- Delete after testing (no ongoing charges)

---

## Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, delete all resources:

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

**Confirmation Prompt**:
```
? Total resources to delete: 6, are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
```

Type `y` to confirm.

**What Gets Deleted**:
- Container Apps Environment
- Both Container Apps (gateway & product service)
- Container Registry
- Application Insights
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Resource Group

**✓ Verify Cleanup**:
```bash
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'rg-microservices')]" --output table
```

Should return empty.

## Expansion Guide: From 2 to 5+ Services

Once you've mastered this 2-service architecture, here's how to expand:

### Phase 1: Add Database Persistence (Next Step)

**Add Cosmos DB for Product Service**:

1. Create `infra/core/cosmos.bicep`:
   ```bicep
   resource cosmosAccount 'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts@2023-04-15' = {
     name: name
     location: location
     kind: 'GlobalDocumentDB'
     properties: {
       databaseAccountOfferType: 'Standard'
       locations: [{ locationName: location, failoverPriority: 0 }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update product service to use Cosmos DB instead of in-memory data

3. Estimated additional cost: ~$25/month (serverless)

### Phase 2: Add Third Service (Order Management)

**Create Order Service**:

1. New folder: `src/order-service/` (Python/Node.js/C#)
2. New Bicep: `infra/app/order-service.bicep`
3. Update API Gateway to route `/api/orders`
4. Add Azure SQL Database for order persistence

**Architecture becomes**:
```
API Gateway → Product Service (Cosmos DB)
           → Order Service (Azure SQL)
```

### Phase 3: Add Async Communication (Service Bus)

**Implement Event-Driven Architecture**:

1. Add Azure Service Bus: `infra/core/servicebus.bicep`
2. Product Service publishes "ProductCreated" events
3. Order Service subscribes to product events
4. Add Notification Service to process events

**Pattern**: Request/Response (HTTP) + Event-Driven (Service Bus)

### Phase 4: Add User Authentication

**Implement User Service**:

1. Create `src/user-service/` (Go/Node.js)
2. Add Azure AD B2C or custom JWT authentication
3. API Gateway validates tokens
4. Services check user permissions

### Phase 5: Production Readiness

**Add These Components**:
- Azure Front Door (global load balancing)
- Azure Key Vault (secret management)
- Azure Monitor Workbooks (custom dashboards)
- CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Blue-Green Deployments
- Managed Identity for all services

**Full Production Architecture Cost**: ~$300-1,400/month

- ✅ Complex applications
- ✅ Independent scaling per service
- ✅ Team autonomy (different services, different teams)
- ❌ More complex to manage
- **Cost**: ~$60-250/month

**Kubernetes (AKS)**:
- ✅ Maximum control and flexibility
- ✅ Multi-cloud portability
- ✅ Advanced networking
- ❌ Requires Kubernetes expertise
- **Cost**: ~$150-500/month minimum

**Recommendation**: Start with Container Apps (this example), move to AKS only if you need Kubernetes-specific features.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why only 2 services instead of 5+?**  
A: Educational progression. Master the fundamentals (service communication, monitoring, scaling) with a simple example before adding complexity. The patterns you learn here apply to 100-service architectures.

**Q: Can I add more services myself?**  
A: Absolutely! Follow the expansion guide above. Each new service follows the same pattern: create src folder, create Bicep file, update azure.yaml, deploy.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: It's a solid foundation. For production, add: managed identity, Key Vault, persistent databases, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring alerts, and backup strategy.

**Q: Why not use Dapr or other service mesh?**  
A: Keep it simple for learning. Once you understand native Container Apps networking, you can layer on Dapr for advanced scenarios.

**Q: How do I debug locally?**  
A: Run services locally with Docker:
```bash
cd src/api-gateway
docker build -t local-gateway .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000 local-gateway
```

**Q: Can I use different programming languages?**  
A: Yes! This example shows Node.js (gateway) + Python (product service). You can mix any languages that run in containers.

**Q: What if I don't have Azure credits?**  
A: Use Azure free tier (first 30 days with new accounts) or deploy for short testing periods and delete immediately.
